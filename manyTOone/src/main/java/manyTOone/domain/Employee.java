	 * HERE i define employee class as parent

	 * i used @ManyToOne mapping and joincolumn for joining the class of child
	 * i saved dummy departments in departmentRunner
	 * i set the many emloyees to one department in employeeRunner
	 * --------------------FETCHTYPE------------------------------
	 * Here i used fetch type to employee parent class
	 * such as EAGER &  LAZY
	 * EAGER can fetch the both records parent and child
	 * LAZY can fetch the parent records
	 * MANY-TO-MANY && ONE-TO-MANY mappings default is LAZY 
	 * ONE-TO-ONE   && MANY-TO-ONE mappings default is EAGER*/
